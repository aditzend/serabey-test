    <div class='panel'>
      <p>
        A new user is created via the form and via a method it is assigned a userssok,
         server side only key.
      
      The router checks if there is a relatedPerson in the user and redirects accordingly.
        
      profileshowpage.js sets relatedPerson on the Session.
      
       If undefined, the profile edit module 
      shows up and the user must fill in contact data.
      
        The user is prompted to create a profile.
        
        A method called createPerson inserts the Person and updates the User document.
        
        Now the user and the person share the same ssok for validation purposes.
